                    Luca Nioi was born in Tokyo in 1993 and is a dual citizen of Japan and Italy.
                    <br><br>
                    He started "playing" piano at age 5, much to the annoyance of his neighbors. Soon he was enrolled in afterschool classical music classes for the sake of their sanity. Ten years and a hundred agonizing Czerny piano exercises later, he'd had enough and turned to jazz and composition.
                    <br><br>
                    From 2012 to 2015 Luca attended Bennington College in Vermont, United States and studied neuroscience, which he remembers nothing of, and music, which, thankfully, he remembers. At Bennington he worked extensively with modern dance performances and theatrical productions as a sound designer and composer. During this period he also worked in Broadway and Off-Broadway productions in New York City and was mentored by sound designer Scott Lehrer.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2016 Luca relocated to Barcelona, Spain, pursuing a parallel career in software engineering and music. He has since been credited as a composer for award-winning short films and documentaries. Currently, he is developing the score for a feature-length documentary capturing the lives of a cyborg community in Barcelona.
